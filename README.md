App created with Android studio and fireBase to connect between Gamers around the world.
The app porpose is to help gamers find gaming buddyes base on mutula liked games,
Each user in the app picks a list of his favourit games from  aviable games,
for each game there's a group chat that the users can speak and schedule playing togher.
also for each chat the user can see the participants and send them private message and also add them to their friend list.
each user has his own custome profile with his details and also ability to upload profile picture.

The app was created with android studio and FireBase DB,
I used RealTime FireBase to save data about the users/games and also to save the chat data.
each users has it's own unique UID, under this UID, there's detailes about the users and it's friendList,
also each group chat is under it's own topic and each private chat grouped toghter by the users UIDs.

In this project I used android studio feautes like Fragments to make the app faster
and Navigation that helps with connectiong between fragments and activtiyes.
